# Introduction

This is a hackathon boilerplate for new Node.js applications created by [Major League Hacking](https://github.com/mlh). It is for hackers looking to get started quickly on a new hackathon project using the Node.js environment.

# <a name='installation-guide'>Installation Guide</a>

This project requires the following tools:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - The JavaScript environment for server-side code.
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - A Node.js package manager used to install dependencies.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - A relational database system.

To get started, install NPM and Postgres on your local computer if you don't have them already. A simple way for Mac OS X users to install Postgres is using [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/). Here is a [Windows guide](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql/) for installing PostgresSQL.

## Getting Started

**Step 1. Clone the code into a fresh folder**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/MLH/mlh-hackathon-nodejs-starter.git
$ cd mlh-hackathon-nodejs-starter
```

**Step 2. Install Dependencies.**

Next, we need to install the project dependencies, which are listed in `package.json`.

```
$ npm install
```

**Step 3: Create an app on GitHub**

Head over to [GitHub OAuth apps](https://github.com/settings/developers) and create a new OAuth app. Name it what you like but you'll need to specify a callback URL, which should be something like:

```
https://localhost:5000/auth/callback/github
```

The default port for our app is `5000`, but you may need to update this if your setup uses a different port or if you're hosting your app somewhere besides your local machine.

**Step 4: Update environment variables and run the Server.**

Create a new file named `.env` by duplicating `.env.sample`. Update the new file with the GitHub credentials. It should look similar to this:

```
# .env file
DATABASE_URL="[INSERT_DATABASE_URL]"
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="[INSERT_CLIENT_ID]"
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="[INSERT_CLIENT_SECRET]"
```

You replace the GitHub credentials here and update the database URL. Learn more about the required [Environment Variables here](#environment-variables).

Now we're ready to start our server which is as simple as:

```
$ npm start
```

Open http://localhost:5000 to view it in your browser.

The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
You will see the build errors and warnings in the console.
